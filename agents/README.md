# Task-Learner Agents
Agents reward other agents as a form of currency and as a way to optimize the path to acheiving common goals.

One agent's objective function may be to minimize resource usage, it will send rewards to agents that minimize these parameters
but the resource agent may receive negative rewards for rewarding agents that perform their tasks poorly (can be quantified by their rewarded values).
